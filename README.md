## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is the first project where I employed react framework. I proved difficult for a first-timer like me, so hard that it had more than 50 commits. I had additional difficulty when I uploaded online since some informations have to linked online. Luckily I had stack overflow to lean on some information inorder to finish the project.



### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me for the json loading issue when i loaded my file online.
- [React deployment on github pages](https://https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) - This helped me in loading my react project in github pages
- [Page for information on screen sizes] (https://www.altamira.ai/blog/common-screen-sizes-for-responsive-web-design/)

## Acknowledgments

The courses I have undergone in Udemy with Dr. Angela is helping me a lot. Had couple of notes during that bootcamp and I'm now they are helping a lot since I can't remember most of the syntaxes.
